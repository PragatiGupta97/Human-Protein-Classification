# Protein Classification Project

This project involves the classification of proteins based on their sequences using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The `protein-classification.ipynb` notebook contains the code and explanations for the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: The raw protein sequence data is transformed into a suitable format for machine learning.
- Feature extraction: Features are extracted from the protein sequences for use in the machine learning model.
- Model training: A machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed data.
- Model evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
